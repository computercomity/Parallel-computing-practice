# Parallel computing practice
This is a coding practice document for parallel compiting based on MPI and Pthread, it is include Odd even sort, Mendlbrot, N body simulation and heat distrbution simulation. A short report is attach to each practice problem.

These four practice samples are used in the course CSC4005 Distrubution and Parallel Computing, if you are the students from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Please do not directly used these codes as your work. The academic honsety is much more important than GPA.
